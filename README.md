# Rivet-Bootstrap

http://www.indiana.edu/~espd/rivet-b/php/index.php

Rivet-Bootstrap is a proof of concept project based off of the Rivet design system currently being developed by the User Experience Office (UXO) at UITS, Indiana University. The premis of this project is to explore the usage of a community-sourced UI framework as the foundation for a design system, and test the ease of customization and extension to that framework.

The underlying framework for Rivet-Bootstrap is Bootstrap (v4.0.0). The framework has been set up in a way that the Bootstrap source can be maintained untouched (and thus, upgradeable), and then the Rivet-Bootstrap 'layer' is applied on top, allowing for style customization via the SCSS css framework. This setup not only allows for detailed customization of the Bootstrap base, but it also facilitates the creation of custom components not found in the Bootstrap or Rivet base libraries.
